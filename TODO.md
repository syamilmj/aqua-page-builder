# Todo Lists

Feel free to add to the todo lists

## DOING

* Caps - allow users with post edit capabilities to build templates
  - authors should only able to edit own template

## FUTURE / REQUESTS

* AJAX-saving blocks
* Enable builder to operate inside post editor
* SEO plugins like Yoast can't read inside shortcode, add support to that
* Bulk actions
* Localize all missing translatable texts (in blocks, etc)

## DONE

* Move template manager on a separate section, preferably similar to how it's done on Menus
* UI minor revamps to follow current WP UI
* Visual Editor
* Template duplications
* Localization
