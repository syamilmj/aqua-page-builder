## AQUA PAGE BUILDER 

* Author:		Syamil MJ - [Aquagraphite.com](http://aquagraphite.com)

### Overview

Aqua Page Builder is a powerful WordPress plugin that allows you to create an unlimited number of template variations for use in your WordPress themes. 
It follows the same user interface used by the Menus & Widgets admin pages - making you feel right at home with the UI.

Similar to the Widgets &amps Menus, Aqua Page Builder features the drag and drop interaction to build its templates.

### License (IMPORTANT)

Aqua Page Builder is released under GPLv3 - [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). You are free to redistribute & modify copies of the plugin under the following conditions:

### Demo

I have created a WordPress theme that demonstrates the plugin's capabilities, featuring a handful of custom blocks which you can use to learn from to build your own custom blocks for your own theme. I'd highly encourage you to purchase the theme. It's not free but consider it as a token of appreciation for my works :smile: See [Cuvette](http://aquagraphite.com/cuvette)

### User Guide

I've written a quite extensive guide for the users so they can get up and running
with the plugin in no time. The link to this guide is provided in the "Help" tab
for easier access, but you can also link to it manually in the theme description or
theme documentation: http://aquagraphite.com/api/documentation/aqua-page-builder
